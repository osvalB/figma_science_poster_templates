## What's in this repository
This (unofficial) repository contains two templates for a scientific poster. The templates were used to present research software (https://spc.embl-hamburg.de/).
The size in pixels corresponds to 72 dpi.

The templates are made available as Figma files (.fig).
Why Figma? Because 1) many persons can edit at the same time, 2) it's easy to use, 3) it autosaves everything as you go, and 4) its' online (no need to send files). 

### Instructions

1) Download the Figma file of interest (.fig), inside the 'figma_files' folder
2) Go to https://www.figma.com/ and log in
3) Import the Figma design file and edit as desired
